NXN Tool allows you to capture HTTP/HTTPS requests and identify potentially malicious traffic.
Each request can be automatically analyzed through VirusTotal, with an indicative score (e.g., 0/95).
A direct link to VirusTotal is available for more detailed inspection.

The software also detects false positives (for example, a 1/95 score).
Customizable filters allow you to modify displayed requests and change the interface language.

Captured data can be exported in .pcap format and imported into Wireshark for deeper analysis.
The capture is limited to 10,000 packets. ``
